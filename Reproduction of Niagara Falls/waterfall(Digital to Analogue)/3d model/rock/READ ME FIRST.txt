These assets were developed by Marcio Meireles de Castro from Infinita Studio.


They are free to use and the inclusion of credits in the project is optional, although it would be nice if you insert it ;)


The package includes:

1 .Blend file with the source mesh set (feel free to modify them)

5 different shape rocks

3 diffuse textures (be careful to change them if you rename or reassign on the .Blend file)

1 normal map texture

1 specullar texture

1 .FBX file (you can ungroup the objects)

5 .OBJ files (one for each rock)

6 rendered images for demonstration.

Any doubts you contact me on www.infinitastudio.com

Cheers!
